# parser-json-to-sql
This repo contains all the necessary material and specifically the script (parser) in order to read and write a large file of data that cannot be read casually on a local  environment. It takes advantage of the python package 'json' to parse the data and the the script also includes the SQL queries to populate the tables (relations) of a realtional database. More specifically, we designed and built a bookstore's database in Postgres for the sake of our analysis. You can tailor the script according to your needs.
