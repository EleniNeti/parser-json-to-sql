But, as it turns out, I should have. Because he tutored the son of Ptolemy III, ruler of Egypt, and went on to be THE LIBRARIAN OF THE LIBRARY OF ALEXANDRIA. \n :O :O :O \n Oh yeah, and he used geometry to learn the circumference of the Earth at its equator. But who cares about that when he held the reins of THE LIBRARY OF ALEXANDRIA. \n Well, it turns out some geographers and mathematicians care about it. And I can understand why, I guess. It is pretty impressive. \n Anyway, this book tells the story of Eratosthenes'' early education, rise as a philosopher, mathematician, and cartographer, and finally his triumph in measuring the circumference of the Earth. The methods he used are carefully (though simply) described, leaving the reader both in awe at Eratosthenes and also feeling that perhaps he could have thought of it himself. :D \n Conclusion.

(Gasp, I know... Also, insert appropriate apology here). The story itself is pretty unique and charming, but I was reminded from the very beginning of A Series of Unfortunate Events by Lemony Snicket. The stories are not anything alike, but the writing felt very similar to me. It''s told in that same third party narrative where the narrator will interject at times with ''clarifications'' and comments. And it also had that same impossibility of character (like the baby biting through steel in ASoUE). \n And I don''t like it. \n I did not enjoy the SoUE. I read most of the books and finally gave up because the story just wasn''t enough to get me over my dislike of the narration and other... things. But I will say that although the narration was, at times, quite jarring to me, overall, I actually really enjoyed this book. \n Once I got past the beginning, where the infant is left to fend for itself by the town elders and survives, I found myself really drawn into the happenings of the story. But it was a struggle and initially, I was really disappointed in the story, because I need my fantasy to be believable and realistic, which means I need to believe in my characters. Once Peter has gotten past his unbelievable childhood, the story really picks up for me. I found that I really liked Peter and I wanted so badly for him to succeed. There was so much at stake for him, and he had so little happiness in his young life that I so wanted things to work well for him. \n The story was quite charming, and again, once past the beginning, this unknown/unseen narrator really does keep his comments and opinions to a minimum, allowing me to get farther into the story. I loved watching Peter learn about his surroundings, learn about himself and realize that he can teach and help others. He worries that his past as a thief makes him unworthy and he often sometimes confidence in himself, which is not surprising considering he''s spent the last several years being told he''s practically worthless. But Peter is strong and he is made of greater things than he knows, and there is much he needs to do in order to complete the quest given him by the mysterious professor. \n His traveling companion, Sir Tode was also a rather enjoyable character. The victim of a Hag''s curse (one that I think you definitely need to discover on your own) Sir Tode is an unlikely companion, but is really willing to be there for Peter, to be his eyes and his friend. \n I''m so glad that I stuck with this book, that I didn''t allow myself to get too discouraged when I started the book. It''s a beautifully charming story, even with the narration being what it is. Peter is strong and brave, and although not perfect (for reasons I won''t specify to avoid spoilers) Peter''s struggles with being blind are raw and real. Peter understands that his skills as a thief are only what they are because of his blindness. He can hear and smell better, and his fingers are far more sensitive. He recognizes this. He knows these things. But he still longs for the ability to see. But he also doesn''t dwell on it. It''s one of those things, it is what it is, and he makes the best of what he has. I love little Peter. \n The fantastic eyes were also such an enjoyable part of the story. I wasn''t sure going into it, but after reading, I can (fairly confidently) say that this is a stand alone story. I had originally thought that perhaps it would be a trilogy, with one book dedicated, primarily, to one set of eyes, but I am happy to say that this story stands alone. All three eyes are used (and umm, pretty brilliant, if I may say so!) and the story resolves itself completely, in that way of all middle grade (ok, most MG). \n I think this is a charming and delightful book, and I think it''s one that will be enjoyed by many, many people. If you are a fan of Lemony Snicket''s writing style, I think you will just love this one. And if you are not, give it a try anyway. It just might surprise you. \n Oh! Also- I loved the small illustrations that started each chapter. They were fabulous additions to the story and they made me all happy inside. :)'),

The salesman uses Peter to help convince the people to buy his wares. When Peter is left in charge of the cart, he can''t help but wonder what is concealed within the haberdasher''s locked carriage. In an hour''s work, the young thief is able to remove a mysterious box. \n Opening the strange box some time later, Peter is disappointed to find only eggs inside. But there are no yolks inside these six eggs--what Peter had were six fantastic eyes. The first pair, gold, whisk him away from the alleys he knows and on course to a remarkable adventure to solve a riddle and find the Vanished Kingdom. \n Peter''s journey is anything but easy. There are physical challenges - a body of water filled with bottles, a harsh desert, and the deepest of pains. There are enemies - treacherous thieves, ravenous sea monsters and a powerful king who keeps children in thrall. At his side is Sir Tode, a knight cursed together with a horse and a cat. In Peter''s burgle sack is the box of eyes, eyes which has been cautioned not to use until the right time else risk dire consequences. In fulfilling his quest, Peter has to learn to trust that which caused his oldest fears and to discover if he is more than just a thief. \n Peter Nimble is a middle grade adventure read that is to be savored.

While jokes and anecdotes are nice, they do not compare with the beauty of shared solitude." \n "There is an old phrase that an insecure man once made up to feel superior to his progeny. Sadly, the saying caught on over the years, and now many people believe it to be true: ''There''s no reasoning with a child.'' As any levelheaded child can attest, this sentiment is pure nonsense.

True to form there is great language and description within the story. I also particularly liked that although Peter is blind, the reader doesn''t feel sorry for him. In fact, Peter has honed his other senses, giving him skills others desire, including thievery. \n What distracted me from the story was the point of view. Although other reviewers consider this 3rd person, I believe it''s more of an omniscient point of view, allowing the author to comment on all situations without allowing the reader to relate strongly / intimately to any character. Whether related to point of view or simple editing, I ended up re-reading paragraphs in a couple places to identify characters in action or dialogue. Granted, this point of view selection did allow for sidelines to the story (i.e. definition of scurvy), which I found quaint. \n One last criticism (spoiler ahead)...in my opinion, the restoration of Peter''s sight seemed counter to earlier themes in the book - that people with disabilities are people too, that they often develop skills to compensate, etc. \n The cover art is beautifully done. There is lots of action for sure. Here again I need the 3 1/2 star rating - somewhere between okay and like. \n Lisa Ard, Author of Fright Flight, Dream Seekers Book One'),

I really enjoyed that tone and feeling because it took me back to those books I enjoyed as a kid. It seems like the actual content is a little more mature, though. Lots of characters die, some of them quite tragically and gruesomely. There''s explicit child abuse. The narrator has a Lemony Snicket sort of style where not everything he says in his asides can be trusted, but I don''t know if the target age range for this book would understand that -- the narrator talks about how apes can go months without drinking water and have a hump to store water in, for instance. An older child would know this is tongue-in-cheek, but a younger child who''s used to those kinds of educational asides might just take it at face value. It''s a chunky book, though... Maybe it''s intended for an older audience, but in that case, it''s the tone that''s weird, and the foreshadowing is much too clear. \n I did really like the characters, especially Sir Tode the cat-horse-man knight and Ole Frederick, the enormous dogfish. The characters are all male for much of the book, but Princess Peg enters the narrative seamlessly later on, and gets some POV time. I loved the concept of enchanted lands interacting with other places more technologically advanced, and that concept plays out nicely. \n I picked this one up because I loved his newer book The Night Gardener. TNG is middle-grade horror while PN&HFE is fantasy. I feel like TNG had more focused themes and was more successful overall, but PN&HFE is still good. Both books are kind of deconstructions of the "crippled Victorian orphan" trope, although I can''t find anything to tell me if Auxier is doing that on purpose... Either way, I think it''s cool. Both books have young boys with disabilities and it''s handled well, a matter-of-fact part of the character''s identity but not the dominant part. Again I think TNG is slightly more successful... PN&HFE does contain magical healing at the end, but it is heavily telegraphed as the story develops. \n 3.5 rounded up to 4 for overall mouthfeel, to continue my food-review metaphor. I''m a little confused, but I enjoyed the book. I don''t quite have a bead on this author yet, but I really want him to write more books, and both his novels so far have been very well received.

The book itself is also gorgeous. The cover and title pages are just beautiful, and the interior illustrations are perfect for it, just sketchy enough to let you feel that Peter''s word is kind of grungy and imperfect. \n This book should really appeal to boys and girls of about eight to twelve, but may be a harder to sell to adults just because of the slow beginning.

We read it together on many occasions as some of the language was a wee bit difficult for him and well it was just fun to read aloud. A great old fashioned epic story filled with adventure, magic, plenty of twists and turns and quite frankly just a fun ride. Some nice dry humour as well. A truly enjoyable story that even adult readers will enjoy. My only complaint is that the last 3 quarters was so good I didn''t want to put it down, and I ended up reading till 1 am. Damn you Jonathan you so owe me a Tim Horton''s Xtra Lg Coffee -- the American XL too!

I felt a real connection to him and loved him throughout the book. \n The first half of the book was a great fantasy and something I could definitely see myself recommending to all the young fantasy lovers in my life. It felt like I was in for an exciting fun adventure. However, halfway through, I found the book lost something. It felt long and I just felt myself being easily distracted.

But maybe that''s just me. \n In the end, I would recommend this to all adventure, fantasy lovers 10+. There are some great characters and great world building, even if I was not fully convinced.'),

My favorite book of all time is Oliver Twist (of course). So when I heard about this one, I couldn''t resist picking it up. \n While Reading: \n Peter Nimble is not only the greatest thief that has ever lived, he is also blind. When he must steal a set of glass eyes for his evil guardian Mr. Seamus, he puts a pair in and is instantly transported to an island. Here he sets off on an adventure that is amazing. Filled with interesting characters, evil villians to be conquered and children to rescue, Peter will need the other sets of eyes to help him. Just what will they do when he puts them in though? \n This book takes the reader on quite the wild adventure and was completely charming. I devoured this rather thick book in a couple of hours and kept thinking about it any time I had to put it down. It is the sort of story that remains with you after you have completed it and makes you ache for more adventures. \n Verdict: \n Definitely a book to pick up and read. It will not disappoint you.'),

Those skills will come in handy when a chance encounter leads him to a mysterious message and then an adventure. Someone sent out a riddle, and now that it''s in Peter''s hands, he''s trying to solve it, with the help of a rather mixed-up knight . . . horse . . . cat . . . creature. He also has a box of magical eyes, whose properties he has yet to discover . . . \n This is a fun little adventure. In fairy-tale tradition, Peter is absurdly talented even as an infant, and develops his skills of thievery quite young. The story keeps toeing the line on such absurdities, which helps keep the tone light even in the midst of some dark things. The characters are a colorful bunch, too, starting with Sir Tode, who was a man before a hag cursed him, his horse, and a kitten into a diminutive conglomeration of those former selves. I would have liked more description of him, as I had a hard time mentally picturing him with the few clues given, but his blustering personality needs no embellishment. \n The mystery of the hidden country unfolds slowly. Although readers can easily pick up on a few things going on right away, the greater plot still hides a few twists. I was hoping to see a bit more magic, as the eyes are pretty much the only active enchantment (there''s also the deal with the sea, but that''s more an environmental hazard). However, the eyes do provide a good deal of fun. \n All in all, this was an enjoyable read, and it wraps up like a standalone (although I actually found this because I was browsing the sequel, so there are more books in which Peter plays a part). I rate this book Recommended. \n See my reviews and more at https://offtheshelfreviews.wordpress....'),

Peter Nimble and his fantastic eyes is one of those rare occasions, where I truly am absorbed by the story and bewitched by the charming characters. \n Now do not mistake me. This story is beyond my imagination, and I find myself wishing I read this many years ago, in a time where sea monsters, flying and all those magical things did not need an explanation. Young adult books often include magical creatures, but they also offer explanations on how those magical beings can exist in the real world. This book however does not offer any explanation at all. \n So, in order to enjoy the book, I started making up theories about the logical explanation behind this story (very wrong of me, I know). And it made the book better. When I was halfway through, I suddenly thought: "what if this story, this adventure, does not actually happens? What if it is Peter''s own imagianation, trying to escape real life? What if all these story''s about friendship, bravery, adventure, fear and happiness is actually our world as we know it, but seen through childrens eyes?" \n And with that particular thought, I finished the book.

I need to gather my thoughts before I can really say anything more .... no sense blasting without some sense behind it!! OK. It''s been a few days now, enough to get the anger out of my "voice". \n So I''ll reiterate .... this book is ridiculous. To the extreme. Now, don''t tell me - ''well, what do you expect? It''s a book for kids. What are you doing reading that sort of tripe anyways?'' I hold to the personal opinion that ALL books can be well written, regardless of the intended audience and to spite of the intended audience, they should stand alone. Sometimes content and context that demands it''s not for younger eyes and minds, but it should be the reverse for kids stuff. It should be fantastical - but not ridiculous that''s parading itself to be fantastic. \n Anyways, enough of the rant. I''ll give you a few reasons to stave this piece of drivel off. Or at least not recommend it to your kids or nieces and nephews. \n First off - it''s such a bad rip off of a bunch of excellent books, taking bits and pieces of the others and mixing it up and presenting it like it''s this great adventure. I found bits of The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Oliver, and Peter Pan. But all watered down, so the circumstances and events just become ridiculous. A quest with extreme circumstances that just don''t ring true, or are so easily overcome that you just shake your head. And with implied violence that the hero overcomes but you never get involved with the intensity - or the bloodshed. You just hear about it later ... "their tears washed away all the blood". Eccchh. Nice. \n Secondly, our hero Peter is a blind boy that''s "forced" to be a thief in order to stay and receive food by his evil master. Yet, there were times that when things are described by him that you think to yourself -"wait. How could he know that? How could he see that? He''s blind!" Then some lame explanation follows and you go ...."What? Pssh. Stupid." Even kids would think that it was stupid my friends. I really hate a book that forgets it''s premise and thinks you will too. Peter may be blind, but you can''t pull the wool over my eyes! \n Thirdly, I just feel soooooo let down with a book that has an interesting idea but falls completely on it''s face and comes up short. I probably should have stopped when I was ahead but I had invested enough into reading it that I couldn''t stop. It seemed like it was going to get better. It just never did. I don''t think I have huge expectations on a book and I know I have the capacity to enjoy fantastical books - science fiction and fantasy are my favorite book types after all - but I do think a book should be well written and no book should be dumbed down. It just disappoints me. \n And I loved the cover too!! Hhahaha!! \n I probably should have never opened the cover. There was only one "endorsement" on the back cover by other authors and that was by Audrey Nieffenegger - and I usually have questions are her writing too.'),

When I was approached about reading this novel for review, I was taken in by the description that it was Dickensian in nature. I love British literature. And as I read Peter Nimble, I could see the plot of Oliver Twist winding its way through the novel, though not quite so darkly. But, there''s a dash of John Green and some Scott Westerfeld or is it Mark Twain or Neil Gaiman. I guess it is uniquely Jonathan Auxier who''s combined wit and plot lends itself a very new voice in an undefinable genre. Though presented as an MG book, I think it could definitely cross over into YA. \n Now, don''t get me wrong, Peter Nimble and His Fantastic Eyes isn''t a warm your heart kind of fantasy at the beginning or even the middle. Peter is found floating in a basket with a raven believed to have pecked his eyes out by sailors. He has no name and when given over to the magistrates of the nearest town, is named, but then turned out as an infant and takes refuge with a mother cat, nursing with her kittens. It doesn''t get any prettier from there and he eventually becomes a thief, a master thief. \n But one fate changing day, he meets a haberdasher and being an expert lock picker, picks the numerous locks on his coach and steals something from him. And this sets him on an adventure of a lifetime with many perils and battles. This is the fantasy part of the story and from then, it''s nothing but nonstop action. It''s got some Steampunk, some magic, fantasy definitely, and lots of sarcastic, subtle humor. It has a dark undertone for the most part yet it doesn''t feel heavy and it isn''t gloomy or depressing. \n Peter, as a character is very likable, if not relate-able. He stays true to his nature. He isn''t evil, he''s just trying to survive at first. But later on, he''s trying to do more. And he''s constantly reminding himself in difficult situations to remain true to his nature, which is a thief. But not for his own gain. And being a thief proves to be quite handy throughout the book. He''s surrounded himself with good people and he sticks with them. \n Peter''s sidekick, Sir Tode, is a knight cursed by a hag to be half horse and half cat. I couldn''t picture how that worked, but thankfully there are pen and ink drawings, done by the author, throughout the book that help and I realized Sir Tode is cat sized, not horse sized. He, too, stays true to his nature, but isn''t all he purports himself to be which is also true to his nature. \n Throughout there are numerous characters, most of them children or ravens, yes as in birds, and the adults, for most of the book are the villains. There is a little bit about how science is thought to be magic by everyone in the Vanished Kingdom including clocks and automated gates. There are some Steampunk like elements in the machinery that the citizens of the Vanished Kingdom believe to be magic as they''ve never witnessed science before. But Peter defeats this so called "magic" and shows them it is just science. The box proves to be magic though, there is no disputing that. And like any fairy tale there is a prince and princess, though not quite in the sense that we are used to. There are no romances. But plenty of talking animals. So really there is something for everyone. \n Most enjoyable to me was Jonathan Auxier''s writing. I don''t know if the humor will be lost on MG readers, but I thoroughly enjoyed his mocking of adults. Or perhaps he will win them over with his subtle encouragement with passages like, "As you know, children (unlike grown-ups) are far too clever to be tricked by impostors-a fact that goes a long way toward explaining their distrust of wicked stepmothers and substitute teachers." (p.214) There was a lot of sarcastic, tongue in cheek humor, my favorite kind, and I found myself smirking as I read. Yeah, I shared a few passages with the men/boys, but I''m not living with book lovers here, so it gets lost on them. They don''t get clever, intelligent humor. \n So, what do I think overall? I thought it was a great story line with great characters. Peter was the main character but not the only interesting one. The story is a stand alone, something I love and is totally complete with a very definite ending. But there is the hint that there could be more stories to come. And it would definitely be a shame to leave Peter Nimble and His Fantastic Eyes in the Vanished Kingdom. Jonathan Auxier''s humor was subtle and honestly, it took me a lot longer to read this book than other''s this length. I think that was because it was truly more literary (I hate to say intelligent or smart so I hope you understand when I say literary) than any other MG novel I''ve read. It didn''t take away from my enjoyment of it at all. It probably increased it because it made it so unique. Sure you can read it as just a story, but I bet you can''t breeze through it. You''ll miss the humor. And it shouldn''t be missed. I highly recommend Peter Nimble and His Fantastic Eyes.'),

It ended up being a great novel; very well written and creative with some wonderful adventure and wonderful characters. \n Peter Nimble was found blind floating down the river as an infant. It''s a miracle he survived; although he is blind. He''s been raised by a horrible man who has made him thieve for a living and Peter Nimble is probably the best thief in the land. His life changes though when he meets a traveling medicine man who asks him to guard a precious box. Well of course Peter has to steal the box and what he finds inside it astounds him; he finds three pairs of eyes. When he puts one of the pairs of eyes in his sockets he is whisked away on an adventure greater than he ever could have imagined. \n This novel is set in Victorian times and is very much a historical fantasy of types with a good dose of adventure. Peter Nimble is a character that is easy to relate to and fun to read about. He is a thief but he manages to comes across as noble and very moral. His sidekick throughout the novel, a knight made up of a mesh of animals is similarly fun to read about. \n Peter embarks on a wonderful adventure through crazy lands. Besides his sidekick, he only has those magical pairs of eyes that he doesn''t know the affect of. The book is well-written with occasional humorous asides by the narrator. The start of each chapter is beautifully illustrated. \n Any middle grade, or older readers, who love fantasy adventure and love a quirky story will love this book. The world created is incredibly creative as is the premise of the stories; the characters are easy to relate to and fun to read about. \n The story ends well, although it is stated that Peter has many other wonderful adventures, which I hope we get to read about in the future! \n Overall an excellent middle grade read. A creative world, interesting plot, and wonderful characters make this a book that is fun to read and hard to put down. Fans of adventure fantasy in a historical setting will find a lot to enjoy here. The beautiful illustrations throughout the story only add to its charm. Definitely a fun and enjoyable read and highly recommended.'),

Not your usual start to a child''s book but the Narrator tells the story with humor and pokes fun at orphan stories; hence, the reader knows that Peter Nimble is no ordinary baby. He was nursed by a cat, tossed in a tied bag into a river and meant to drown, and enslaved by Mr. Seamus, a thief who taught Peter all the tricks of the trade so Peter became the best thief that ever lived. "Until this point," the Narrator says, "you have been witness to Peter''s rather typical infancy - probably not unlike your own." Peter meets the Haberdasher whom he steels a box from that contains three pairs of eyes. Peter uses the eyes and ends up on a quest, with a cat-horse cursed knight, to save a kingdom and discover a place for himself in the world. \n The characters in the book are fun such as Officier Trolley who says his sentences so fast they sound like one word or Peg who is a no-nonsense in-the-face girl working hard to survive in terrible conditions. The pacing is fast and the Narrator''s voice interesting. The Narrator keeps the violence in the story at a distance using humor - which is good - considering the surprising amount of characters that get killed. The plot has some loose ends that aren''t tied up such as Old Scabbs and why the raven''s killed him. The narrator also explains difficult words in funny ways and sometimes goes too far explaining the plot such as on page 144 when the Narrator foreshadows the thieves betrayal; thus, taking out all the tension in the plot at that point. It''s the only time I felt truly ticked at the Narrator. The author obviously loves Peter Pan and there are references to the classic throughout the story. A fun fantasy adventure.'),

It''s charming, witty and is definitely an unforgettable read. With everything Peter Nimble''s story entails, this book has the same feel as the classic, ageless fairy tales I grew up reading or had read to me. Jonathan Auxier''s fresh voice combines an array of timeless fairytale elements, and yet creates a story that in unlike anything I''ve read before. \n Peter Nimble is a character who doesn''t lack courage, he''s humble, and through everything he goes through he''s someone who always stays true to himself. His story will pull at readers heart strings as they read about the things he''s had to endure and overcome in his young life, but this unique, strong willed, good hearted kid is no weakling. It''s true his epic journey will be full of trials, heart ache, fear, doubt, bravery and trust both in himself and his abilities, and in those he meets along the way. Blinded as an infant, ten year old orphan, Peter Nimble has never let that stop him from surviving and being able to take care of himself. He''s intelligent and is able to sense what many people with site are blinded by. He''s earned the nicname, The World''s Greatest Thief, and for a good reason. It seems there''s no predicament Peter can''t get himself out of. \n One of the most enduring aspects of this adventure is Jonathan Auxier''s voice and his vivid descriptions of the characters and places Peter travels to. He has a way of bringing the unimaginable to life. I liked how his creativity made for some interesting characters like talking animals, the traveling companion and true friend to Peter named Sir Tode whom is also Knight and a mix between a kitten and a horse. Talking ravens, an evil King, evil talking Gorilla guards, brave children, a long lost Prince, a Princess in hiding, and fantastic eyes who aid Peter on his journey. There isn''t a shortage of adults in this story, but the are foreshadowed by the amazing children who are the true heroes in the book. \n This is a fantastic heroic adventure with some fabulous twists, action and so much more! Just like the classic fairy tales, there is a great message within the story''s pages, along with a mix of heartbreak, happiness, a few scary/mildly violent scenes, and in the end a happily ever after. In order to find out what Peter''s happily ever after is, you''ll need to read the book. I can safely say, I definitely wasn''t excepting it. I highly recommend picking up Peter Nimble and His Fantastic Eyes. This is a book that boys and girls aged 10 yrs & older will really enjoy.'),

It has a complex plot, frolicking adventure, fantastic characters, and surprise endings. For the right child, it would be a great journey of the imagination. For me, though, it was lacking in some key areas. \n I loved the concept behind the Fantastic Eyes. Having a blind hero led to some interesting narrative devices and an unusual perspective for the main character. The imagery was necessarily rich, and certainly unique. Sometimes it was near unbelievable the world was so...exotic. But it was always fun. \n The characters were, by and large, pretty flat. Peter is well-developed and undergoes an important transformation over the course of the book. But all of the secondary characters are basically archetypes, even Sir Tode the bizarre sidekick. \n It has the style of Lemony Snicket, with periodic author asides and fun jabs at popular culture. Auxier makes it a point to carry his theme of the superiority of children throughout the story, repeatedly making adults look silly (very believably so). It''s thick with little pieces of humor and strange creatures and new animals. It''s fun, just plain old romping fun. But that''s about it.'),

I loved Peter''s adventure, and I especially love how it was all secretly set just to reveal his true identity in the end. I was able to guess a few surprises in the plot, like how Peter was the NoName prince right after Peter learns about this prince and whether he is still alive or not, but it didn''t ruin the story for me at all. It was so thoughtful that the author came up with such plot surprises and that''s what made me enjoy the story even more. As soon as it was mentioned that Peg had green emerald eyes, I started thinking that maybe the green eyes which Peter hadn''t used yet would give him vision and they''d live happily in the palace, which exactly happened and I was happy about that ending. I just didn''t like how Peter lost his right hand after already struggling with a disability. I didn''t think that was fair and it upset me, but it''s okay.'),

Peter being blind sets him apart, not only in this novel, but in the MG genre in general. During one of his excursions, he finds a box containing three pairs of magical eyes. The eyes and a message in a bottle provide him with a great adventure. I really loved that. It''s whimsical and completely different, but draws from all the great adventure book themes. There''s even a knight (of sorts), Sir Tode, who is a combination of a horse and a cat. \n I love this book. I can''t even describe why I like it so much. Parts of it are predictable, but it''s never boring. It''s whimsical and delightful. It''s the kind of book that I imagine younger children would like to have read to them before bed. \n The book is divided into three parts (one for each pair of eyes).

Brilliantly conceived, filled with masterful descriptions that provoke not only the imagination with sights, but also with sounds, smells and touch. From the first few paragraphs I was spiraled into a story, much like Alice falling down her rabbit hole, and caught up in a tale of the completely fantastic and I loved every single second of it. Every one. \n Now and then I''ll pick up a middle grade book and, more often than not, I''ll put it down feeling an overwhelming urge to pet a kitten or cuddle a puppy, but sometimes, those rare, few, precious times, I put the book down and feel as if I''ve been transported back in time and I''m 11 years old again and surrounded by a word of magic and mystery; a world where a boy without eyes can overcome impossible odds, where a knight without bravery can overcome his cowardice, and where a lost fantasyland can be found again. Peter Nimble and his Fantastic Eyes is one of those stories. \n One of the most brilliant, fantastic things about this book is way Auxier describes not only the people Peter comes in contact with, but also the places he visits and the things he does. Peter is blind, he has no eyes, and since the book (even though it''s in third person) is from Peter''s main point of view, we''re treated to smells, touches and sounds. If a man is tall, we know because of the sound of his tread, if two people are related it''s due to their smell. All this is done in such an exquisite way that it slipped by, unnoticed, until a moment came and I felt as if I''d just woken up and the world around me began to sparkle. \n Bravo, Jonathan, bravo. \n I cannot rave about this book enough. If you loved Gregor and the fantastic world Suzanne Collins made in her books, if you loved Plain Kate by Erin Bow, then you will adore this story of Peter Nimble, the blind thief. There are books I love, books I tolerate, books I cannot stand - but every now and then I come across a book like this one where I feel privileged to be allowed to read and experience the story. \n Thank you, Jonathan Auxier, for giving us this story.'),

As you can well imagine, blind children have incredible senses of smell, and they can tell what lies behind a locked door- be it fine cloth, gold, or peanut brittle- at fifty paces. Moreover, their fingers are so small and nimble that they can slip right through keyholes, and their ears so keen that they can hear the faint clicks and clacks of every moving part inside even the most complicated lock. Of course, the age of great thievery has long since passed;today there are few child-thieves left, blind or otherwise. At one time, however, the world was simply thick with them. This is the story of the greatest thief who ever lived. His name, as you''ve probably guessed, is Peter Nimble." \n My Opinion: I absolutely LOVED this book! Yes, it is an MG book, and yes, I am an adult, but I enjoyed every minute of this book and couldn''t put it down! I''m so excited for my sons to read it because it has everything they could want in a book: action, adventure, heroes and villains, fighting and thieving!! What boy wouldn''t want to dive into it! \n Peter Nimble has had a very difficult life. He is found abandoned as an infant, with his eyes having been pecked out by the crows who are found with him. He scrounges out a life as best he can, until he is taken in by a cruel man who teaches him to be the best thief in the world so he can steal for him in exchange for the meager food and board he provides. All that changes when Peter steals a box with three pairs of eggs in it - and magically, each pair of eggs has a pair of eyes in it. When Peter puts in the first pair of eyes he is transported to an island where a kind man takes him in and explains that these eyes are meant only for Peter, to help him on a quest to save a damsel in distress. Peter sets off on the adventure of a lifetime, where he finds his destiny. \n This was such a fantastic, magical book, and I definitely recommend it to all fans of fantasy and adventure, who love a good underdog to root for :D'),

I will warn you that it contains a good bit of violence and some gorey parts, but I have found that children do not mind those sort of things as long as they are in context. This is a classic story of good vs. evil told in the perfect voice of Peter Nimble. This will not be a story that is easily forgotten.'),

The site is simple, the sketches are fun and that might be the best "about me'' section I''ve ever seen. So to hear Jonathan was publishing his first middle-grade this fall, literally made me giddy. Then I found that this particular middle grade novel is set in a quazi-Victorian age, starring a blind-orphan-thief. \n Here''s what I need: books that I can look a kid in the eye and say, "Trust me, you''re going to love this." So that while they''re developing their reading (and thinking) strategies, they''ll fall in love with literature and see the relevancy for these skills. I''m looking for books that create "the circulation effect" (I pass off a book and by the time it''s returned two months later, I''ve seen it on 15 different desks). I''m quite confident that Peter Nimble and his Fantastic Eyes will be one of those books. \n First and foremost, Peter Nimble has an absolutely mesmerizing flow to it. It''s got all the fun of disenfranchised Dickens mixed with Phantom Tollbooth absurdity. Jonathan Auxier seamlessly blends these two very diverse attributes, strapping his readers to his back as he takes them along for a breakneck ride through complete obscurity. One minute you''re meeting his traveling companion, an enchanted horse-cat-knight; the next minute you''re giggling over a reference to 18th century burgling proverb. And that''s what makes this novel so much fun. \n Auxier immerses you in this wonderfully substantial tale while relentlessly sprinkling in bits of humor at every turn. To really buy into fantasy, there needs to be in a believable world. In a lot of the high-fantasy for middle-graders that I''ve read, this tends to get a bit descriptive. Not that it''s a bad thing, most of the time it''s completely essential to the story. But for inexperienced readers who haven''t built the stamina to stick it out, such description can slow the story down to abandonment. Auxier does much of his world-building through an astute sense for humor. Thieving terminology and old sayings build Peter''s culture. This enables the author to spend less time creating the world and more time pushing Peter through it. And the reader can pick the rest up along the way. \n By omitting the overly descriptive elements of fantasy, we''re left with a story that moves at a truly exceptional pace. Take my knees for example. I had an hour to kill before heading home for dinner. I made my way over to the beach with Peter Nimble in tow. Before I knew it three hours had passed, my legs were cooked, and I was late for family dinner. \n The chapter structure and pace just work sensationally. Some end in total cliffhangers, others are satisfying bookends; all without ever feeling predictable or formulaic. Sometimes a section was wrapped up nicely when I assumed it would stretch out, while other times I thought I knew how a chapter would end only to be left with a dropped jaw and a yearning to find out where we''re going next. And all of this happens from the moment we set foot into Peter''s tale. \n Right from the introduction it''s clear that we''re in the hands of a storyteller. It doesn''t feel like the characters or the narrator know something that you don''t. The information we learn in the beginning later becomes pertinent but it never comes off overly mysterious. There''s nothing wrong with employing those strategies at a story''s onset but doing so risks losing that audience that isn''t quite ready to pick out the questions they''ll need to keep in their heads for a few hundred pages. \n Another major component of Peter Nimble''s flow is the manner in which we meet new characters and explore new settings. The story''s landscapes constantly shift without inundating the reader with detail. We grow accustomed to Peter''s new surroundings with him. Seeing as how Peter is blind, both he and the reader are exposed to the setting by moving through it. Characters too, flow in and out without coming off hollow or hurried. \n But the essential thread that ties this novel together is Jonathan Auxier''s outstanding narration. I''m always telling my students, "You can''t talk to your reader unless you really mean it." And when they ask me what that means, I tell them, "I don''t know. But go read Adam Gidwitz or Lemony Snicket." \n Bad narration is intolerable and insulting to the reader, which makes discovering quality narrators that much more satiating. Auxier guides us through Peter''s story without ever tipping his hand or pandering to his readers, unless he''s doing so intentionally, in which case, it''s pretty damn funny. He''s constantly dropping bits of humor that range from explicit to embedded to ludicrously sarcastic. And we haven''t even touched the most impressive part... \n Our main character is blind. The disability drives the story without ever becoming preachy or asking the reader for sympathy. It''s refreshing to have a main character whose handicap is the source of his success (without him having to learn some character trait by coming to terms with the disability). In fact, frequently, the disability becomes the butt of many a pun. Good. We certainly want to teach our kids to treat everybody, able or handicapped, with respect. It''s nice to see Peter isn''t discluded from good-natured humor at his expense, like so often is the case when disabilities appear in children''s literature. \n Peter Nimble and his Fantastic Eyes is sure to be hit with middle grade boys and girls alike. At times it''s utterly absurd; others, rich and poignant, but it always remains sensationally obscure. And if nothing else, it''s that current of obscurity running throughout the novel that will charge its readers and keep them chuckling until the last page. \n It''s my job to get emerging readers the skills they need to be proficient with text. But what good is a skill set if you can''t find a relevancy in it? I say I have just as much a responsibility to help my readers find both. Many times, it requires some salesmanship. And, a salesman is only as good as his product. Books like Peter Nimble and his Fantastic Eyes makes engendering students to take ownership of their reading easy. It''s the caliber of story that is simply... Fantastic.'),

The worldbuilding was fun and lighthearted--from clockwork to magic eyes to a giant dogfish...that''s actually a *dog* fish--but classy. I felt like I was reading Lewis and Tolkien at some times, as well as some ofther old and great authors. There was a bit of shocking violence, which was not out of place but just a matter-of-fact in an imperfect world that needed to be saved. \n Bottom line, Peter Nimble and His Fantastic Eyes was a real treat to read.

Young Adult is okay but I feel with JF there''s just more imagination. For a writer to be able to write books for children, I applaud them. It takes lots of amount of imagination and thinking on what children might like. Peter Nimble brought me back to my childhood times. \n The thing about this book is that it never got boring. One adventure led to another. For Jonathan being able to create an entire world around a blind boy, it''s amazing and fresh new take. Even though, Peter can''t see anything, he has other 4 senses to help him be the greatest thief the world has ever known. \n You shouldn''t judge anyone by their appearances. At first, Peter just looks like a blind, homeless little boy. But in reality, Peter is not only blind but a skilled thief that can hide in the shadows, open any lock, stay as quiet as a mouse, and steal something from your pocket without you even noticing. He is a thief but everything he takes goes to his guardian. Even in this dark tale of thievery, there is still some light. \n One day, when his thievery was at a low point, a gentleman asks Peter to watch his carriage full of locks until he comes back. Peter being full of curiosity, and skill at picking locks, takes this as a challenge. He gets inside and sniffs out (literally), and finds a box that holds something valuable inside. He snatches the box, and opens it later on. With a little help from a zebra, Peter finds out the box actually contains 3 pairs of eyes. \n One pair leads him to an island where he meets Sir Tode. Sir Tode is a special type of knight. He''s a cat with hooves of horse, and a really fancy mustache. He also meets a Professor, who gives Peter a quest to save a kingdom from an evil king. His skills of thievery are needed, which will lead him to his destiny. \n I love everything about this book. It was fresh, adventurous, and had a new type of hero. \n -Danny'),

I expected an incredible story behind how he lost his eyes - especially after some of the reviews I read on this site, but there was none. It happened, he had no eyes, and that was that. That''s the crux of what bothered me about Peter''s situation. A horrible thing was rendered dull because it lacked emotion. Even his awful living circumstances - very reminiscent of Dickensian orphans - lacked feeling, making them disgusting but not as sympathetic as the author might''ve intended. \n I noticed a few uncomfortable transitions that made me wonder if I missed a page in between, but I didn''t read past the seventh chapter, so I can''t tell you if this improved. \n I appreciated some descriptive passages, and there was the hint of excitement, but the excitement was inhibited by the narrator and the style in which the story is written. \n My favorite scenes were when the narrator wasn''t quite so intrusive and I got to see Peter do something impressive.

It''s kiddish, but it''s fun and exciting, and it rather denotes a certain time period, even though I have no idea where or when this takes place. \n Characters: Peter Nimble is a quick-thinking young boy, who tries to do what''s right, but has kept company with the wrong people, and therefore has something of a distorted view on what''s right and what''s wrong. When it comes to helping people, though, he knows what''s right. And he takes pride in his skills, though he gradually begins to struggle with the idea of being nothing more than a thief. I frankly enjoyed a character who was willing to do what needed to be done, even if it required his thieving skills. I am a practical person, and I like practicality in my protagonists, too. Sir Tode took a little while to grow into my affections, as his appearance was very bizarre. A cat with horse hooves and a mustache? Once I gave up trying to envision him, I liked Sir Tode quite a bit. He offered a streak of comic relief that actually worked quite well. He was a good and loyal friend who rightly cautioned Peter Nimble when the boy trusted the wrong people. And can I just say - I loved all of the crows. They were just awesome. Old Scabbs immediately put my teeth on edge, he was too much like Gollum: untrustworthy, constantly scraping and blubbering, and above all has horrible hygiene - oh yes, and he''ll put a knife in your back as soon as he can. I don''t feel sorry for characters like these, and I don''t really feel sorry for protagonists who trust them. I just want characters like Old Scabbs to be put out of their misery. They''re like a rabid dog; death would be a kindness. Thankfully, Old Scabbs wasn''t around for too long, though he at first threatened to become a permanent fixture. The villain was actually rather terrifying. We don''t get to meet him for very long, but his reputation was enough. \n The Romance: There isn''t any! \n Plot: Peter Nimble was found floating in the ocean, a crow having pecked out his eyes. But Peter Nimble wasn''t adopted by a kind family; no, he was left to the streets, he learned at an extremely young age how to fend for himself. He now works for Mr. Seamus - a criminal who employs urchin children to steal for him. Peter Nimble lives a wretched life under Mrs. Seamus'' cruel hand, until the day he burgles a strange haberdasher''s even stranger wagon. He finds a box that contains three pairs of Fantastic Eyes. And when Peter Nimble puts a pair of Fantastic Eyes into his empty sockets, he is transported to the home of Professor Cake. There, Peter Nimble learns that it is up to him to find the Vanished Kingdom and save it from an unknown evil. The Fantastic Eyes have been crafted for him for this very journey. Peter is only to use them when he must, but he''ll know when the time is right to use them. With his newfound strange companion, Sir Tode - a hexed knight, - and an incomplete riddle, Peter Nimble sets off on one of the most bizarre adventures ever to grace Middle Grade literature. I adored this book, but it also took me a long time to decide what I exactly thought of it. The Fantastic Eyes are just strange, and when the first pair transport Peter to a lake filled with messages-in-bottles, I was totally confused. Where was this book going?! Once Peter Nimble and Sir Tode start out on their adventure, things get a little more clearer, though no less bizarre. It takes on more of a purpose, and it keeps you guessing all the way to the end. That isn''t the say that the twists aren''t predictable - they kind of are. But they''re still really good, and part of what makes this book so memorable is the cast of major and minor characters - all of them quite memorable - and the bizarreness of the world. The book is also surprisingly dark. People and children are killed, and the Vanished Kingdom is now controlled by a tyrant who has created a world that is dystopian in nature - and a very eerie utopia, at that. But throughout it all, the narration maintains a very comic, Snicket-ish tone. Which almost makes it darker. \n Believability: Not applicable. A time period and place is never specified. Is it Liverpool? Victorian era? It doesn''t really matter, I suppose. \n Writing Style: Third person, past tense. There''s an omnipotent narrator - the Author - which lends the Reader the ability to see what''s going on, when Peter Nimble can''t. The style is rich and vivid, ironic and darkly humorous. I loved it. \n Content: None. \n Conclusion: Like I said, some of the twists are predictable. Does it lessen the fun of the conclusion? No. The conclusion itself is quite exciting and promises a great companion novel: The Night Gardener. I didn''t really know what to expect of Peter Nimble and His Fantastic Eyes. With a title like that, I knew it had to have magic and be rather quirky. I wasn''t expecting it to be quite as dark as it was, nor as magnificently memorable as I found it to be. But I can definitely see why so many people raved about this book. \n Recommended Audience: Girl-and-boy read, nine-and-up, great for fans of Lemony Snicket.'),

Mr Seamus is not a nice man and uses Peter to steal riches from others while Peter is locked in a cellar with barely anything to eat. Peter became blind when he was a baby: he was found in a basket by the sea and a raven had pecked out his eyes. Peter is miserable and alone until he meets a strange tradesmen by the ports and steals a wooden box. What is in the box changes Peters life forever: eyes. The eyes are from Professor Cake who sends Peter and his new cat-horse knight, Sir Tode, on a magical adventure to save a kingdom. Peter learns that although he may be blind, he is strong and brave. This is a really amazing adventure story of a young boy with a disability who uses it to his advantage and doesn''t let it slow him down. Jonathan Auxier does a fantastic job of creating a magical world for all the weird characters that don''t belong in any other book to mingle and work together. Sir Tode, who is a knight who has been turned into a mix between a horse and cat, apes who have become warriors, talking animals, Professor Cake, and more. I found myself so curious as to what would happen next and how Peter would get out of each particular mishap he found himself in. The only weakness I find with this book is that the content might be scary for young children, such as the ravens pecking out a young boys eyes and there are other death scenes in the book. Overall, I would highly recommend this story for any children who want to read a fantastical adventure through magical lands. Grades 4-10.'),

Peter is a likeable character and the world he inhabits is very original as are the trials & tribulations he encounters.

Fantastic narrator, seriously made me laugh out loud. Especially the very beginning I constantly chuckled. In some ways it reminded me of The Phantom Tollbooth, but it reminded me of a lot of things all in good ways and it was so original too. The quirky humor was catching. The descriptions are a good balance, being in third person allows some to be done normally. Other things were done more from Peter''s perspective as a blind boy.

The only clues I''ve found about its existence come from a short, cryptic rhyming poem. This quest is pretty momentous for a young thief who happens to be blind; my eyes were pecked out by ravens when I was a baby. I have a box containing three pairs of eyeballs, and the golden ones have transported me to a strange world. I''ve met a brave knight, Sir Tode, to be my eyes, but a witch changed him into a horse/cat. He''s become the first friend I ever had. Our journey has taken us across a desert full of banished criminals, and we fought for our lives against an army of ravens. We''ve now met a princess who has been hiding from her evil uncle for the past ten years. It seems like our destinies are linked, but the full truth of our futures remains to be discovered. \n I enjoyed this book more than I expected. The eyeballs had different "powers", and the black ones were used the most. They allowed Peter to become whatever creature he last touched, whether it be a raven, beetle, or sea monster. Predictably, Peter''s character had an important connection to the Vanished Kingdom. The most intriguing part of the plot was how his character''s blindness seemed to have advantages over everyone else. He could sense elements of the setting that others missed using his senses of touch, smell, and hearing. Rather than pity him, other characters tended to see him as a leader. Sir Tode was an entertaining character, as he was more exaggeration than actual hero. However, he was extremely loyal to Peter, and they worked well as a team. The story sends a message that people may be more than they seem, and faith and loyalty will be rewarded. It''s a fun book!'),

But what appears to be the beginning of an action-and-adventure-filled series starring a persevering and original cast of characters is in reality an imaginative but half-hearted tale foiled by an amateur voice and copycat style. \n By his own admission in the book''s acknowledgments, Auxier is a thief like his protagonist Peter Nimble. Snatching "inspiration from countless other worlds, characters, and books," his crime is readily apparent. Young, blind, orphaned Peter is of the Dickensian trope and his behavior follows accordingly. He is born of dubious circumstances and ends up in the "care" of a corrupt guardian. He is forced to commit crime but is possessed with deep moral fiber. He is but an innocent, virtuous child graced with an adventuresome spirit who is, in spite of all handicaps, clever and highly self-sufficient. Peter''s friends, sidekicks, and saviors supplement and assist his adventures in a traditional fairy tale manner, appearing in times of duress and possessed with powers sufficient for the impending challenge. There is Professor Cake, an eerie human caricature of C.S. Lewis''s Aslan in omniscience and puissance; Sir Tode, an enchanted knight serving as Peter''s loyal sidekick and a bumbling cross between the Chesire Cat and Don Quixote; King Incarnadine, Peter''s nemesis and villainous uncle of Princess Pam, wearing clockwork armor that''s borrowed from a villain of Marvel comic Hellboy fame; and the monstrous ape army, serving as Night Guard in Incarnadine''s palace, reminiscent of the Wicked Witches'' flying monkeys in The Wizard of Oz. Peter''s entrance into the magical realm is similarly burgled from other tales. Like Alice falling down the rabbit hole, the titular Fantastic Eyes transport Peter to the aptly named Troublesome Lake, kicking off our protagonist''s fantastic adventure. The Eyes themselves are a unique narrative device and it is quite pleasurable to discover, along with Peter, their magical powers. Young readers will find some of the more absurd characters, like Sir Tode the cat-horse-man and Simon the beakless raven, amusing and fresh. \n All this theft on part of Auxier makes for an imaginative fairy tale and adventure quest "mashup". However, the delivery and pace of the fiction lacks warmth. There was no joy or wonder in Auxier''s words. While the plot moves along at a nice pace for young readers and is suitable for the action-and-adventure genre, the content lacks depth and the narration is erratic. The beginning of the tale is lush with description of a magical world (simply look at some of the place names: Just Deserts, Troublesome Lake, Kettle Rock, et al) while Peter''s adventures are simply accounted for. The narrator explains and jokes with the reader in some scenes - Vitamin C turns into Vitamin Sea, a nutrient in lemons to prevent scurvy from afflicting pirates and sailors - then hurries the action along in the next by stating simple facts along the lines of, "this happened, then that, and then Peter felt distraught and hopeless." I paged through Peter''s adventure impatiently, past whale-sized dogfish and raids with banished thieves and perfect palace lives that seem all too perfect, waiting for a delivery that was anything but fantastic or nimble (hee hee). \n By the third and final section, the book had shifted dramatically. Gone are the witty remarks and the conspiratorial laughter of the narrator explaining unnecessarily complex adult notions. Instead, grotesque descriptions of battle produce an unjustifiably violent affect. Child readers can handle exposure to cruelty and violence, but the line is tenuous - just look at best-selling authors like William Golding and Suzanne Collins, who wrote books in which children commit violence. Peter Nimble is witty and compelling in a first read because of the narrator''s cloying voice, reminiscent of my favorite childhood author Roald Dahl, and this voice vanishes irrevocably into the thick of battle. Furthermore, Auxier fails to produce either narrative justification or consistency for descriptions of violence in the culminating escape and battle. In one scene, where the raven army is pitted against Night Guard apes for control of the palace, the carnage of the nearly overpowered ravens turns the waters of a flooded hallway deep red. Later, the machinery of King Incarnadine''s armor destroys Peter Nimble''s hand to the point that it must be amputated later and replaced with a fishing hook (Captain Hook, anyone?). These descriptions, together with other chillingly honest moments, give a tale of good toppling evil a revolting twist. \n All these weaknesses can be traced back to a single error: Auxier, like many well-intentioned YA authors, writes for his audience and not for his story. He creates a truly fantastic world full of characters infused with attributes loved in other acclaimed fairy tales... only to lose his imaginative spark as the fiction''s dubious hero toils on. By the final section, when our well-meaning hero has the chance to prove his worth as the greatest thief who ever lived (and likely most honorable), the drawn-out action and predictable moral summations excised all former attention and exhilaration. No reader turns the page to be told the action. It''s the author''s job to use language and unique skill to show and share it. Unlike poor Peter Nimble, the reader will not blindly mistake Auxier''s dim and dark HazelPort with the visionary depth and clarity for which imaginary realms like Narnia, Wonderland, Oz, and Neverland, not to mention contemporary creations like Hogwarts and Panem, are acclaimed. \n Peter Nimble and His Fantastic Eyes should be a celebration of a child''s world triumphing over the dim, dull and illogical rule of adults. Instead, it pays homage to Lord of the Flies. Wide-eyed adventure no more, this tale suits better the Brothers Grimm.'),

I have yet to read a book by this author that I haven''t loved and Ghost Knight will sat happily on my book shelf next to the author''s other books which I have loved. \n This book is an excellent ghost story written for the 9 to 12 age bracket, set in the stunning surroundings of Salisbury; inspired after a visit to Salisbury Cathedral on a book tour. Considering that Cornelia does not live in England, her writing portrays the characters and the setting in such a way that you would think she had lived here for years. I am amazed by her talent as she seems to be the first international author to truly be able to recreate life in England within her stories. \n The book is extremely well written, completely engaging and I was totally absorbed from beginning to end. It reminded me of the classic ghost stories I read as a child, such as The Children of Green Knowe and Moondial. \n The main character Jon, is sent to boarding school and you instantly think of Harry Potter. Yet this boarding school is a little more realistic in appearance, yet it is filled with some rather gruesome ghosts rather than magic. The ghosts within the story are pretty scary, so I wouldn''t recommend for the younger children, but definitely an ideal book for the 11 to 12 year olds as long as they don''t frighten to easily. Jon''s friend, Ella was based on a real person who is really sassy and stands no nonsense from anyone. She was definitely my favourite character within the story. \n The author brings to life historical figures and I loved the way the plot centred around them, offering a little bit of history disguised in a thrilling tale. It made me desperate to explore Salisbury, especially Stonehenge and the Cathedral. The UK is filled to the brim with ghost stories that need to be told, so I am so pleased to find one as wonderful as this. \n The illustrations in the book are stunning and helped to bring the story alive. I really would like to see more 9 to 12 books with illustrations, even in older books, the odd picture would be nice. \n This is an ideal winter read for those cold, snowy nights - an excellent Christmas present for the older spookily enchanted child.'),

John and Ella agree to help the knight, answering both questions about John''s family history and why Sir Longspee spends his time as a ghost helping people. \n Although there are lots of ghosts and a general sense of danger, there are multiple reassurances that the ghosts cannot touch them, helping the story get rid of any possible scariness. The story is also told from John''s adult perspective, again reassuring young readers that all will be well for the main characters in the end but also removes any tension.

To do so he gets help from a girl named Ella and a long dead knight. \n The story is full of great characters, who I hope we will see more of, and has lots of action; though I think that I''ve been spoiled by J K Rowling. Her stories took place over the course of a year, so you could see the changing relationships and watch the characters develop. This takes place over the course of about two weeks. I am not a fan of short timeline plots. There just isn''t the space for character development and I would have liked to see more of the supporting cast. \n Though the bookstore had this in the young adult section, I believe it belongs in the "older reader" category. This would have great appeal to fans of The Graveyard Book. It''s well illustrated and reads quickly.'),

First his mom starts dating a guy he hates, and now he is being shipped off to some private school he knows he''s going to hate. Clearly, it just can''t get any worse for him. That is, until a group of ghostly horsemen that only he can see start threatening his life. \n While it may appear that Jon is the main character by that description, which I suppose technically he is, it is his friend Ella who is the real star of the book. She''s strong-willed and intelligent, and Jon just feels flat, insubstantial dullard by comparison. The plot mostly involves Jon being an idiot and Ella guiding him along his path, which is fine, except it just made me wish Ella was the main character. Jon is a weak character with no personality, which is bad when the story is told from his perspective. \n Speaking of the story, I wasn''t terribly enthusiastic about it. Maybe it harkens back to my problems with Jon, but I had a hard time being emotionally involved in what was happening. The story moved from one event to the next far too quickly, and while I don''t expect literary depth from a children''s novel, the characters never really reflect on what''s happening before they are off to the next situation. \n There are a few positive things I can say. I liked Ella and Zelda, and the last couple chapters were surprisingly good because there was a teensy bit of character development at the very end of the thing, but it was too little too late, and doesn''t change the fact that half the time I felt like I was forcing myself to read it. When the text is so big that there is barely more than a couple paragraphs per page and you still feel like your struggling to turn the pages, there''s a problem! 2 stars.'),

Once he gets there he discovers that the challenge of meeting new friends is not nearly as pressing as the challenge to stay out of the clutches of a trio of vengeful marauding spirits that seem to have a personal grudge with him. Because this is Cornelia Funke, after all, the world of the book is highly developed, and it''s actually loaded with history. Funke based some of the ghost stories on some real ghost stories and legends and you can tell that she has a real affection for the characters--the ghostly ones at least. I can''t help but feel like something feels like it''s missing with Jon and Ella, the children at the heart of the story. It feels at times like Funke is trying to patch together the dark fairy tale quality of the history and the legends with a much more lighthearted school story for younger readers and it doesn''t completely work. The modern characters and plot get shortchanged a bit and the side-plot of Jon''s relationship with his stepdad-to-be feels a little forced and hurried along. I feel like if she could have committed to writing it for an older audience and went a little darker overall, it could have been a much more interesting book. I would give anything to see her research notes for this book though. \n I could see this being a readalike for Avi (I''m thinking of Midnight Magic in particular).'),

Once I listened to this book for a little while I was able to start enjoying this book for its own merit. \n I am a huge fan of the Inkheart trilogy (although I''m still upset about what Ms. Funke did to Farid and Meggie) and loved Reckless as well. At first I was disappointed that this book was set in the modern time period though this soon passed as Ms. Funke''s brilliant word play became more obvious. \n I also enjoyed the setting immensely simply because I had the opportunity to visit Salisbury (and Old Sarum) two years ago and could picture a lot of the landmarks Ms. Funke described. \n One of the few things that I did not enjoy was some of Ms. Funke''s descriptions of the ghosts (the main villain who''s name escapes me at the moment) and the ghost battles, especially the climactic one.

When the train pulls into the rainy little town of Salisbury where he will be attending boarding school, Jon has no idea what he is in for. \n Despite homesickness weighing him down, Jon quickly makes friends with his roommates - Stu and Angus - as well as a mysterious, rather frosty girl named Ella. He even manages to eat the awful food. What Jon never expected however was that a vengeful ghost with a grudge centuries old would come around, hunting the last of the Hartgills.

It was most likely just me as I don''t particularly dig ghost stories. The characters were all creative and lively - Zelda''s unique habit of cursing using strange plant names was a real treat for me. I loved that little character quirk! From a Christian perspective, this book is silly; everyone knows that if you rebuke the ghost in the name of Jesus it will flee away. *winks* Still, I liked the knight and his sweet, sad story. And the illustrations were beautiful! \n Rating: PG-14 and up, mainly for content which includes ghosts and their ghostly, bloody descriptions. The reading level is easy.

Un-bridged by role of deal, tension and sadness cling to their souls. Longspee is beautifully weak but also heroic (with none of the pretty-boy Hercules stereotypes.) His fragile soul and the young soul of Jon have bonded together and it''s ironic in the way that they rely on each other. Longspee needs Jon to put him to rest, but Jon requires protection. \n I suppose it''s this harmony that makes her concept of mortality to attractive. Or perhaps how sentimental it is, for you''re jerked around with the character''s questions and needs and uncertainties and desires. But they all are fluid and blend into one another, showing how fragile all humans are. \n I don''t know how to describe the phenomenon; however, it is incredible and takes my breath away even at a young adult level. I recommend this for any middle school or even 5th grade student, because as long as the reader can comprehend these simple but overwhelming messages, they will be affected without a doubt.'),

In one case, a whole episode felt too rushed, but it turned out to be a deliberate plot point. \n After fighting with his mother''s new boyfriend, a serious enough relationship that they might marry, Jon is sent off to a boarding school to cool down and to separate him from his potential stepdad. Unfortunately, his mother, never a student of family history, has sent him to a place where his family had a long history, and some of the local ghosts have it in for Jon. \n From local ghost hunters to Norman knights, the story wanders in and out of human realms in seriously creepy ways. Funke blended history and folklore to create a fast-paced fantasy. \n I don''t think she quite thought through part of the happy ending, but it sets up interesing things if she writes a sequel.'),

Jon''s widowed mother has recently started dating seriously a man Jon only calls "The Beard." Jon''s sisters--and even his dog--adore this new man in their lives; Jon does NOT. He has tried everything he can think of to make The Beard go away. Nothing has worked and now he is the one being sent away to go to school at his father''s alma mater. For Jon this is cruel punishment. He is filled with fear about his new living arrangement and rage at The Beard--who he sees as responsible for this turn of events. \n Although the house wardens who meet Jon--Edward and Alma Popplewell--are kind and patient and his two new roommates, Angus and Stu, are also welcoming, Jon is determined to remain miserable. He does not allow anyone''s kind words or gestures of friendship to interfere with his resolve to be so unhappy that his mother will feel horribly guilty (and possibly bring him home). \n Jon is distracted somewhat from his mission to stay miserable when he hears horses at night and looks out his dormitory window. On the ground, looking up at him, he sees three mounted ghosts. There are hideously gruesome in appearance and they are smiling evilly at Jon. When one draws his pale sword it begins to drip with blood and Jon feels a pain in his chest. \n Understandably, as he stumbles away from the window, Jon is terrified. He soon realizes that NO ONE ELSE can see these spectres. And it is not the last time Jon is to encounter them either. He will soon be drawn into the tale of an old family murder and those who seek revenge for it. \n Jon will not have to face his fears completely alone however! He meets the mysterious--and imperious--Ella Littlejohn and her grandmother Zelda (who used to give ghost tours in Salisbury and consequently has much information that may be helpful to Jon). Ella also introduces Jon to the legend of the knight that is buried in the Cathedral at Salisbury; he is said to have taken an oath to appear and come to the aid of anyone who calls for him--as long as he (or she) is truly in need. \n Unexpectedly, Jon discovers truths about himself, about friendship, and about his way of relating to other people in the world as he and Ella--with the help of Sir William Longspee--attempt to untangle centuries of deceit, murder and revenge. The fact that each of us has the capacity for both good and evil and the difference lies in our personal choices becomes an important theme in the story--and in particular for Jon. \n The story is fast-paced and often heart-poundingly suspenseful! I know my heart sped up during several scenes! The ghosts and historical events referred to in the story--including the murders and betrayals--are actual historical facts, which Ms. Funke lists at the back of the book. For me, this always makes a book more exciting to me when it interweaves itself with the reality of our lives! \n There ARE battles and truly evil characters so I would not recommend the book for younger than 3rd or 4th Grade--and even then it will depend on the sensibilities of the individual reader. But I do HIGHLY recommend Ghost Knight as a thrilling read!');
